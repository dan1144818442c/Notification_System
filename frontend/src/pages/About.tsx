            This application was built by Hershi Shor to provide a solution for
            the "Kodkode" soldiers in the important need of sharing posts
            between the soldiers, The desire was to build a modern and clean
            website with a minimalist design that makes it feel good to the eye
            and pleasant to the user, the website is secure with a double layer
            of protection of user registration and receiving a token to confirm
            login and perform actions. I hope the website will serve you
            faithfully and you will see added value in it and from it. Hershi
